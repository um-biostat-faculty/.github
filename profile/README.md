# Welcome to the UM Biostat Faculty Organization!

This organization serves as a holding place for department faculty to share code.
While repositories can be made publicly available, the original intent was for internal sharing and collaboration.

All access is manually configured, so you must be added to the GitHub organization via request before you can use it!
